How to compile and run the code :

1. creat a text file "that the client read the input from" (ex : ali.txt ).

2.compile the server code :
gcc aliserver.c -o aliserver

3. compile the client code :
gcc aliclient.c -o aliclient

4.run the server : ./aliserver 7000  
(7000 example of server port number) .

5.run the client : ./aliclient 127.0.0.1 7000 1000000 ali.txt   
(127.0.0.1 The server IP address)
(7000 example of server port number) 
(1000000 the number of micro-seconds the client waits between sending
subsequent requests to the server) 
(ali.txt this is the file that was created) .


*After execution, a file will be created by the server, where the information is recorded on it , its name is (servfile.txt) .
